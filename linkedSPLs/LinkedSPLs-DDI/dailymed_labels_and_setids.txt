1) See the file dailymed_htmls_and_textnumbers.txt. It explains the
relationship between the URLs provided in the file and sections in the
subfolders in the attached zip file

2) the urls that have NDC codes ([http://....ndc=...]http://....ndc=...) should be pretty easy to use. Take the NDC code and search for it in DailyMed. The result should be a label. Open the section(s) and search for some text from the
section. If you get a match, that is the setid to use!

probably get the setid from the xml
