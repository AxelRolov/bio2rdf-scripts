Workflow (as of 01/18/2017):

1) Data from the FDA's pharmacogenomic biomarker table
 <http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/Pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm>
 is downloaded and reformated into a pipe-delimitted file
 (genetic-biomarker-table-raw-import.csv). This data is periodically
 updated by the FDA. The script in check-pharmgx-site-for-updates.cron
 can be added as a cron job to check regularly for changes on the
 website. 


2) The script 'createFDAPharmgxDBTable.py' is ran over the table. For
listings with multiple active ingredients, the script searches for
combination products. The script logs if combo products exist that
contain all of the active ingredients and dumps the pharmgx row data
into the log file. If there is a problem identifying any of the
moieties because no combo products exist in linkedSPLs, this is noted in the
log file as an ERROR. If there are no errors, the data is appended to
the file "FDAPharmgxTable.csv". 

NOTE: IT IS CRITICAL to add the lines that the script writes at the
end of the log file to the FDA active ingredients-to-rxcuis mapping
file.

3) The file biomarker-to-ontology-mapping.csv contains a manually
created mapping between the FDA biomarker strings, Pharmgkb, and the
PRO ontology. This mapping can be used to generate all kinds of other
mappings as well as facilitate distributed queries. The methods for
conducting the mappings will be released in forthcoming conference
papers and journal articles.

Note: for the list of HGNCGeneSymbol in HGNCGeneSymbol.txt

1) pick one term as a representive of combo
BAFF/TNFSF13B search as TNFSF13B 
BCR/ABL1 as ABL1
ESR1, PGR as PGR
FIP1L1/PDGFRA as PDGFRA
PML/RARA as RARA

2) some of item does not found in http://cu.hgnc.bio2rdf.org/sparql
del (5q)
IFNL3
NAGS, CPS1, ASS1, OTC, ASL, ABL2
NAT1-2
Ph Chromosome
